# Snake Game

Day 20 & 21 of 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Learning Outcome
On day 20, We learnt to:
1. Built a snake using 3 square shape
2. Move the snake by changing the position of square to its previous square. For example, square 3 or its tails will change its position to position of square 2, and square 2 will change its position to square 1. This way when the head of the snake change direction, all its body and tail can follow.
3. Change direction of the snake (up, down, left, right) and make sure the snake doesn't move to its opposite direction. For example, when it's heading upward, we don't want it to be able to go downward.
4. Use screen.tracer() to turn off the auto animation
5. Use screen.update() to refresh the screen whenever we want to refresh it. That way the movement of snake will be smoother
6. Use time function to delay the program
7. Make Snake Class
